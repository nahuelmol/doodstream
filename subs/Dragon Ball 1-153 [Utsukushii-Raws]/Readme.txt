I retimed these files to the "Utsukushii-Raws" release of original Dragon Ball using Kaegi's "Aligner tool".

Note: I ran the aligner tool using an automated process, and since there are so many episodes, there is a possibility of errors that I have not found, but I have checked many episodes, and most seem to be timed correctly. The only episode I could find that turned out wonky is episode 25.

Nonetheless, enjoy the show :)
